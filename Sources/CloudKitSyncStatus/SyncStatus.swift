/// The current status of iCloud sync as reported by `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`
///
/// `SyncStatus` listens to the notifications sent out by `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`
/// and translates them into a few published properties that can give your app a current state of its sync.
///
/// The primary use for this is to detect that rare condition in which CloudKit (and therefore your app) will just stop syncing with no warning and no notification
/// to the user. Well, now there's an immediate warning, and you can notify the user.
///
/// This SwiftUI view will display a red error image at the top of the screen if there's an import or export error:
///
///     import CloudKitSyncStatus
///     struct SyncStatusView: View {
///         @available(iOS 14.0, *)
///         @ObservedObject var syncStatus = SyncStatus.shared
///
///         var body: some View {
///             // Report only on real sync errors
///             if #available(iOS 14.0, *), (syncStatus.importError || syncStatus.exportError) {
///                 VStack {
///                     HStack {
///                         if syncStatus.importError {
///                             Image(systemName: "icloud.and.arrow.down").foregroundColor(.red)
///                         }
///                         if syncStatus.exportError {
///                             Image(systemName: "icloud.and.arrow.up").foregroundColor(.red)
///                         }
///                     }
///                     Spacer()

/// `SyncStatus` has a few "magic" properties, which are featured in the example above, and are what you
/// really should use. Avoid the temptation to offer a continuous "sync status", and _absolutely_ avoid the temptation to detect when "sync is finished",
/// as in a distributed environment (such as the one `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer` is part of), sync is never "finished", and you're asking for
/// "bad things", "unpredictable results", etc if you attempt to detect "sync is finished".
///
/// Anyway, the "magic" properties are:
/// - `syncError`, which tells you that something has gone wrong when nothing should be going wrong (i.e., there's an active network connection)
/// - `importError`, which tells you that the last import failed when it shouldn't have (i.e., there's an active network connection)
/// - `exportError`, which tells you that the last export failed when it shouldn't have (i.e., there's an active network connection)
///
/// Detecting these conditions is important because the usual "fix" for CloudKit not syncing is to delete the local database. This is fine if your import
/// stopped working, but if the export stopped working, it means that your user will lose any changes they made between the time the sync failed and
/// when the user noticed the failure. Previously, that time was based on when the user looked at two devices and noticed that they didn't contain the same data.
/// With `SyncStatus`, your app can report (or act on) that failure _immediately_, saving your user's data and your app's reputation.
